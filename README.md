# python-ETL

# Libraries required to be installed:
pip install openai==0.28\
pip install pandas\
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

# IDEA:
Build a Python program to Extract, Transform, and Load a list of games, adding through the OpenAI ChatGPT the review of each game from an initial CSV list.\
The idea was based in the code developed by Venilton Falvo Jr that did a similar consultation to ChatCompletion API but getting ChatGPT creating him users recommendations about financial investing.

# Components:
GamesReview.py\
games.csv
